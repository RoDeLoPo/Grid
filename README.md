# Grid
Grid is aimed to be a cross-platform BOINC GUI that not only makes BOINC easier to use, but also more involving.

It's goal is to make the UI simpler and more elegant, and, in the future, include features that can make BOINC more fun to use, such as:

<ul>
<li>Rank system: <i>rank up as you acquire more credit</i></li>
<li>Friend's list: <i>add friends, track their progress, join in teams or compete</i></li>
<li>Facebook integration: <i>share your achievements on Facebook</i></li>
</ul>

# Download

Grid is currently only available for Windows (though other ports are coming soon). You can download it through SourceForge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boinc-grid/">here</a>.

<i>Note: Grid is currently in very early development stages, so you might (probably will) find bugs.</i>
